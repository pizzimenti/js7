## Doing

As a user, I want a task to have a description, and I need to know if it's done or not.
As a user, I want to be able to edit existing task descriptions and create new tasks
As a user, I want to be able to view which tasks are done, and which tasks are not done.
As a user, I want tasks to start out set to "not done". But I want to be able to click a checkbox to mark them as "done". I would also like the ability to uncheck a box to mark the tasks as "not done", in case I realize I messed one of them up and I have to do it over.

## Done
